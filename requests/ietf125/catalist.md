# Name

Coordinating Agent To Agent List of efforts (CATALIST)

## Description 

Non-WG-Forming effort to coordinate among the many attempts to develop IETF work around agent-to-agent (especially AI agent) communications.

Over the last few IETF meetings there have been a considerable number of side meetings focused on agent-to-agent communications (especially for AI agents). The subject material varied from high-level architectures, through requirements and use cases, to protocol proposals. The work has included discovery mechanisms and approaches to selection of cooperating agents. It was hard for even a committed IETF participant to follow all of these meetings especially considering conflicts with the regular IETF agendas, and it seems likely that there will be further side meetings at IETF-125.

This BoF provides an opportunity to:

- Catalog the active efforts and their scopes (e.g., discovery,
  capability exchange, protocol proposals, frameworks, data models,
  security approaches)
- Identify common requirements and gaps that might be suitable for
  IETF standardisation (and those that are not)
- Agree on clear boundaries and terminology to reduce duplication
  and confusion
- Map work items to existing IETF building blocks and working groups
  where appropriate. 

CATALIST is explicitly not intended to pick between competing proposals, nor to prematurely define any end-to-end agent communication protocols. Instead, the meeting will provide a forum to share information about these efforts and to offer some coordination and consolidation so that the ADs and the wider IETF community can see where proposals to form working groups and develop IETF work may fit. The responsible AD might choose to see this as a "dispatch-style" effort for the work.

Note that this BoF is not intended to squelch discussions at side meetings which can continue to be useful to develop and discuss ideas in detail. But, by consolidating into a single meeting it should allow a better overview to be achieved.

We suggest the session be held as earlier as possible in the week, as several questions raised will be discussed during side meetings during IETF 125.

## Relevant I-Ds and Links

There is a discussion mailing list at agent2agent@ietf.org. This is list discusses possible areas for standardization related to AI agents. The list might result in proposing a BoF, a side meeting or an IAB Workshop. 

Further links to be added depending on agenda items, but see list of prior work above.

We will also work on creating a wiki.ietf.org page for tracking the coordination effort. This will provide a shared repository where proponents of related initiatives can briefly summarise their work and link to the relevant home pages, key documents, and other supporting information (e.g., drafts, GitHub repositories, mailing lists, and slide decks).
